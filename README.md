## ZeDS: Zero Day Shadow
Set in the year 21XX, a technological island called Kalta was born to balance out technology worldwide by research, development and distribution in a balanced way, and to keep tech information infinitely free around the globe. It is the most advanced island in the world with all kinds of people from all parts of the world living in Kalta. By being a very valuable island full of cutting-edge technology, people living on the deep part of Kalta started rebelling for power. When the imbalance of power arises and chaos spread all around Kalta, two mysterious anti-heroes shows up to save the island...maybe?
## Demo Characters
### Emilibot
![Emilibot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565401989836570629/667076673346207773/unknown.png)

Emilibot is an original spybot created by [REDACTED] for [REDACTED] as their private bot. There are only one instance of this bot. The spybot doesn't have any particular AI nor advanced programming into it, as this bot are purposely created to be controlled by a living human. Even though it lacks a lot of automated programs, Emilibot is far than capable to do more than what normal spybots can. This big-sized spybot are capable of ultimate superficial high-tech cloaking, which only use a very small power consumption and can run as long as the generator is active, with the only downside not being able to deal any offensive attacks. Other than a cloaking capability, [REDACTED] thought it would be a good idea to add a near-to-lightspeed boost called blink, which can speed up Emilibot to the point it seemed like it's teleporting. [REDACTED] also fitted Emilibot with a super powerful Ion Laser that could deal high ion damage to anything related to technology, stunning them for a good amount of time, though this weapon needs a long amount of time to be charged. The last addition to Emilibot is it's highly quick reboot that [REDACTED] implemented in order for quick recovery from ion damages. Day by day, Emilibot are only used by [REDACTED] and each day, it always kept improving. By the way, who is/are [REDACTED]?
### Dummy Drone

Dummy Drones, used to be owned by Arnofica, are outdated version of the Military's multipurpose drones that sizes as big as an average human male. The initially called MPD0 are produced in a small amount as these drones has their own programmed Artificial Intelligence and are capable of basic decision making. Even though the MPD0 has a very strong and fast body movement, these products are considered a failure, as they lack the capability of initiating attacks due to a flaw in the AI's programming. Because of these drone's strong body, these old multipurpose drones are used as a dummy for human and or newer version drone military trainings, hence the name "Dummy Drone". Most of the drones has been acquired by big corporates and wealthy individuals, and has been reprogrammed for other purposes. Though some had said to have gone rogue...
### Flying Drone

The MCSD-MK1, or as common people likes to call "Flying Drone", are the first installation of Arnofica's Military Class Combat Swift Drones that was designed for powerful defense purposes that could be sent out in a short amount of time, and in a large amount of units. These type of drones bears powerful rapid plasma cannons that can shoot fast and deadly. Although, Arnofica has since installed a newer version of MCSD which are more powerful and quicker than the MCSD-MK1. The now publicly known "Flying Drone" are being sold by smugglers and NetPirates in the blackmarket, and are mainly bought by big companies as their defensive units.

## Gameplay
### Time Trial

Located in an Abandoned Factory in south of Brogs District, plenty of metal scraps surrounded the factory which are filled with rusty drones. With plenty of facilities that could still function properly, it is a great spot as a training ground. There is even a time trial facility which were used to test out new drone capabilities with different layouts for either ground units and or flying units. This facility was used to be a drone or bot factory owned by DroCorp. which were specialized in creating multiple types of drones mainly for general use. Unfortunately, it was abandoned due to a systematic failure combined with a lawsuit that they were loosing. For that reason, there are a lot of drone and bot parts that could be found. 

### Time Trial (Target Practice)

While the time trial facility was great for testing out the capabilities of each drones, it is only mainly used for mobility assessment and not for firepower assessment. Due to the lack of firepower training ground, the people who took control of the factory decided to modify the facility and made a new type of time trial facility that test both mobility and firepower capabilities. Since then, this facility also ended up abandoned but few bunch of individuals are still using it from time to time.
